## CSC 675 Databases Project

## By Denzill Loe

This is a project involving a database modeled and forward engineered in MySQLWorkbench, hosted remotely using MyRemoteSQL, and controlled via a Discord bot in a channel.
Feel free to look at each of the milestones and look at the work done at each stage.
